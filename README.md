# Springboard Assessment: Node/Express Assessment 2

## Project Description
This project is designed to assess your understanding and skills in using Node.js and Express, focusing on both conceptual knowledge and practical problem-solving abilities. It is divided into three parts: Conceptual Questions, a JavaScript coding challenge, and a debugging exercise for an existing Node.js application. This assessment aims to reinforce your understanding of key Node.js and Express concepts, improve your problem-solving skills, and prepare you for real-world debugging scenarios.

## Part 1: Conceptual
In this part, you will answer a series of questions related to Node.js and Express. The goal is to test your theoretical understanding of these technologies. You will provide your answers in a file named `conceptual.md`.

## Part 2: `Timeword.js`
This coding challenge requires you to write a JavaScript function that converts a 24-hour time string into a corresponding word representation. You will:
- Implement a function that transforms a given time string (formatted as HH
) into a readable word format (e.g., "00:00" becomes "midnight").
- Ensure your solution handles various cases correctly, such as "01:00" becoming "one oâ€™clock am" and "12:00" becoming "noon".
- Write tests for your function to validate its correctness without using any external libraries.

## Part 3: Buggy App
In this part, you will work on an existing Node.js application named bankly, which simulates a financial system. The application is generally well-written and has passing tests, but it contains several bugs that are not currently being tested for. Your tasks include:
- Getting the application up and running using the provided commands
- Carefully reading the documentation and existing tests to understand the intended functionality
- Identifying and fixing at least some of the six known bugs within the application. This involves writing new tests that expose these bugs and then modifying the code to correct the issues
- Documenting each bug you find, along with the corresponding test and fix, in a markdown file.
